* 👋 I'm Julia, a software engineer and incoming computer science student at Columbia University.
* 📂 I enjoy [exploring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.0438) the intersection of math & CS. Previously, I interned at [Fiveable](https://fiveable.me).
* 🎲 As an avid Hack Clubber and puzzle enthusiast, I'm always up for a game of Word Hunt, Set, or ERS.
