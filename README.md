# Hi! 👋 I'm Julia Ding
I'm a high school student 🏫 located in Austin, Texas interested in all things STEM, more specifically computer science 👩🏻‍💻 and mathematics 📐. I love promoting STEM 💻 to the community! In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello 🎻, puzzling out fun math problems, and making bad puns.
